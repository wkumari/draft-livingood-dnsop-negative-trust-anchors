    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction and motivation" toc="include">
      <t>DNSSEC has now entered widespread deployment. However, the DNSSEC
      signing tools and processes are less mature and reliable than those for
      non-DNSSEC-related administration. As a result, operators of DNS
      recursive resolvers, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
      occasionally observe domains incorrectly managing DNSSEC-related
      resource records. This mismanagement triggers DNSSEC validation
      failures, and then causes large numbers of end users to be unable to
      reach a domain. Many end users tend to interpret this as a failure of
      their ISP or resolver operator, and may switch to a non-validating
      resolver or contact their ISP to complain, rather than seeing this as a
      failure on the part of the domain they wanted to reach. Without the
      techniques in this document, this pressure may cause the resolver
      operator to disable (or simply not deploy) DNSSEC validation.</t>

      <t>This document defines the Negative Trust Anchor (NTA), which can be
      used during the transition to ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment. NTAs are
      configured locally on a validating DNS recursive resolver to shield end
      users from DNSSEC-related authoritative name server operational errors.
      NTAs are intended to be temporary, and only implemented by the
      organization requiring an NTA (and not distributed by any organizations
      outside of the administrative boundary). Finally, NTAs pertain only to
      DNSSEC and not to Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) such as X.509.</t>

      <t>Use of an NTA to temporarily disable DNSSEC validation for a specific
      misconfigured domain name immediately restores access for end users.
      This allows the domain's administrators to fix their misconfiguration,
      while also allowing the organization using the NTA to keep DNSSEC
      validation enabled and still reach the misconfigured domain.</t>

      <section anchor="Definition-of-a-Negative-Trust-Anchor"
               title="Definition of a Negative Trust Anchor" toc="include">
        <t>Trust Anchors are defined in <xref target="RFC5914"/>. A trust
        anchor is used by a validating caching resolver as a starting point
        for building the authentication chain for a signed DNS response. By
        way of analogy, NTAs stop validation of the authentication chain.
        Instead, the validator treats any upstream responses as if the zone is
        unsigned and does not set the AD bit in responses it sends to clients.
        Note that this is a behavior, and not a separate resource record. This
        NTA can potentially be implemented at any level within the chain of
        trust and would stop validation from that point in the chain down.
        Validation starts again if there is a positive trust anchor further
        down in the chain. For example, if there is an NTA at example.com, and
        a positive trust anchor at foo.bar.example.com, then validation
        resumes for foo.bar.example.com and anything below it.</t>

      <section title="Motivations for Negative Trust Anchors">
        <section anchor="Domain-Validation-Failures"
                 title="Mitigating Domain Validation Failures" toc="include">
          <t>A domain name can fail validation for two general reasons: a
          legitimate security failure such as due to an attack or compromise
          of some sort, or as a result of misconfiguration on the part of a
          zone administrator. As domains transition to DNSSEC, the most common
          reason for a validation failure has been misconfiguration. Thus,
          domain administrators should be sure to read <xref
          target="RFC6781"/> in full. They should also pay special attention
          to Section 4.2, pertaining to key rollovers, which appear to be the
          cause of many recent validation failures.</t>

          <t>It is also possible that some DNSSEC validation failures could
          arise due to differences in how different software developers
          interpret DNSSEC standards and/or how those developers choose to
          implement support for DNSSEC. For example, it is conceivable that a
          domain may be DNSSEC signed properly, and one vendor's DNS recursive
          resolvers will validate the domain but other vendors' software may
          fail to validate the domain.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="End-User-Reaction"
                 title="Improving End User Experience" toc="include">
          <t>End users generally do not know of, understand, or care about the
          resolution process that causes connections to happen. This is by
          design: the point of the DNS is to insulate users from having to
          remember IP addresses through a friendlier way of naming systems. It
          follows from this that end users do not, and should not, be expected
          to know about DNSSEC, validation, or anything of the sort. As a
          result, end users may misinterpret the failure to reach a domain due
          to DNSSEC-related misconfiguration . They may (incorrectly) assume
          that their ISP is purposely blocking access to the domain or that it
          is a performance failure on the part of their ISP (especially of the
          ISP's DNS servers). They may contact their ISP to complain, which
          will incur cost for their ISP. In addition, they may use online
          tools and sites to complain of this problem, such as via a blog, web
          forum, or social media site, which may lead to dissatisfaction on
          the part of other end users or general criticism of an ISP or
          operator of a DNS recursive resolver.</t>

          <t>As end users publicize these failures, others may recommend they
          switch from security-aware DNS resolvers to resolvers not performing
          DNSSEC validation. This is a shame since the ISP or other DNS
          recursive resolver operator is actually doing exactly what they are
          supposed to do in failing to resolve a domain name; this is the
          expected result when a domain can no longer be validated and it
          protects end users from a potential security threat. Use of an NTA
          would allow the ISP to specifically remedy the failure to reach that
          domain, without compromising security for other sites. This would
          result in a satisfied end user, with minimal impact to the ISP,
          while maintaining the security of DNSSEC for correctly maintained
          domains.</t>

          <t>It is worth noting the following text from <xref
          target="RFC4033"/> - "In the final analysis, however, authenticating
          both DNS keys and data is a matter of local policy, which may extend
          or even override the protocol extensions defined in this document
          set." A responsibility (one of many) of a caching server operator is
          to "protect the integrity of the cache."</t>

        <section anchor="Switching-to-a-Non-Validating-Resolver-is-Not-Recommended"
                 title="Avoiding Switching to a Non-Validating Resolver"
                 toc="include">
          <t>As noted in <xref target="End-User-Reaction"/>, some people may
          consider switching to an alternative, non-validating resolver
          themselves, or may recommend that others do so. But if a domain
          fails DNSSEC validation and is inaccessible, this could very well be
          due to a security-related issue. In order to be as safe and secure
          as possible, end users should not change to DNS servers that do not
          perform DNSSEC validation as a workaround, and people should not
          recommend that others do so either. Domains that fail DNSSEC for
          legitimate reasons (versus misconfiguration) may be in control of
          hackers or there could be other significant security issues with the
          domain.</t>

          <t>Thus, switching to a non-validating resolver to restore access to
          a domain that fails DNSSEC validation is not a recommended practice,
          is bad advice to others, is potentially harmful to end user
          security.</t>

    <section anchor="Use-of-a-Negative-Trust-Anchor"
             title="Use of a Negative Trust Anchor" toc="include">
      <t>Technical personnel trained in the operation of DNS servers must
      confirm that a DNSSEC validation failure is due to misconfiguration, as
      a similar breakage could have occurred if an attacker gained access to a
      domain's authoritative servers and modified those records or had the
      domain pointed to their own rogue authoritative servers. They should
      also confirm that the domain is not intentionally broken, such as for
      testing purposes as noted in <xref
      target="Intentionally-Broken-Domains"/>. Finally, they should make a
      reasonable attempt to contact the domain owner of the misconfigured
      zone, preferably prior to implementing the NTA. Involving trained
      technical personnel is costly, but operational experience suggests that
      this is a very rare event, usually on the order of once per quarter (or
      even less).</t>

      <t>It is important for the resolver operator to confirm that the domain
      is still under the ownership / control of the legitimate owner of the
      domain in order to ensure that disabling validation for a specific
      domain does not direct users to an address under an attacker's control.
      Contacting the domain owner and telling them the DNSSEC records that the
      resolver operator is seeing allows the resolver operator to determine if
      the issue is a DNSSEC misconfiguration or an attack.</t>

      <t>In the case of a validation failure due to misconfiguration of a TLD
      or popular domain name (such as a top 100 website), content or services
      in the affected TLD or domain could be inaccessible for a large number
      of users. In such cases, it may be appropriate to use an NTA as soon as
      the misconfiguration is confirmed. An example of a list of "top N"
      websites is the <xref target="Alexa">"Alexa Top 500 Sites on the Web"
      </xref>, , or a list of the of the most-accessed names in the resolver's
      cache.</t>

      <t>Once a domain has been confirmed to fail DNSSEC validation due to a
      DNSSEC-related misconfiguration, an ISP or other DNS recursive resolver
      operator may elect to use an NTA for that domain or sub-domain. This
      instructs their DNS recursive resolver to temporarily NOT perform DNSSEC
      validation at or in the misconfigured domain. This immediately restores
      access to the domain for end users while the domain's administrator
      corrects the misconfiguration(s). It does not and should not involve
      turning off validation more broadly.</t>

      <section title="Applicability of Negative Trust Anchors">
        <t>A NTA MUST only be used for a limited duration. Implementors SHOULD
        allow the operator using the NTA to set an end time and date
        associated with any NTA. Optimally, this time and date is set in a DNS
        recursive resolver's configuration, though in the short-term this may
        also be achieved via other systems or supporting processes. Use of an
        NTA MUST NOT be automatic.</t>

        <t>Finally, an NTA SHOULD be used only in a specific domain or
        sub-domain and MUST NOT affect validation of other names up the
        authentication chain. For example, an NTA for zone1.example.com would
        affect only names at or below zone1.example.com, and validation would
        still be performed on example.com, .com, and the root ("."). This NTA
        also SHOULD NOT affect names in another branch of the tree (such as
        example.net). In another example, an NTA for example.com would affect
        only names within example.com, and validation would still be performed
        on .com, and the root ("."). In this scenario, if there is a (probably
        manually configured) trust anchor for zone1.example.com, validation
        would be performed for zone1.example.com and subdomains of
        zone1.example.com.</t>

    <section anchor="Managing-Negative-Trust-Anchors"
             title="Managing Negative Trust Anchors" toc="include">
      <t>While NTAs have proven useful during the early stages of DNSSEC
      adoption, domain owners are ultimately responsible for managing and
      ensuring their DNS records are configured correctly.</t>

      <t>Most current implementations of DNS validating resolvers currently
      follow <xref target="RFC4033"/> on configuring a Trust Anchor using
      either a public key as in a DNSKEY RR or a hash of a public key as in a
      DS RR.</t>

      <t>Different DNS validators may have different configuration names for
      an NTA. For examples see Appendix A.</t>

      <t>An NTA placed at a node where there is a configured positive trust
      anchor MUST take precedence over that trust anchor, effectively
      disabling it. Implementations MAY issue a warning or informational
      message when this occurs, so that operators are not surprised when this
      happens.</t>

      <section title="Alerting Users to Negative Trust Anchor Use">
        <t>End users of a DNS recursive resolver or other people may wonder
        why a domain that fails DNSSEC validation resolves with a supposedly
        validating resolver. As a result, implementors should consider
        transparently disclosing those NTAs which are currently in place or
        were in place in the past, such as on a website <xref
        target="Disclosure-Example"/>.</t>

        <t>This is particularly important since there is currently no special
        DNS query response code that could indicate to end users or
        applications that an NTA is in place. Such disclosures should
        optimally include both the data and time that the NTA was put in place
        and when it was removed.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Removal-of-a-Negative-Trust-Anchor"
             title="Removal of a Negative Trust Anchor" toc="include">
      <t>As explored in <xref target="Security-Considerations"/>, using an NTA
      once the zone correctly validates can have security considerations. It
      is therefore RECOMMENDED that NTA implementors should periodically
      attempt to validate the domain in question, for the period of time that
      the NTA is in place, until such validation is again successful. NTAs
      MUST expire automatically when their configured lifetime ends. The
      lifetime SHOULD NOT exceed a week. There is limited experience with what
      this value should be, but at least one large vendor has documented
      customer feedback suggesting that a week is reasonable based on
      expectations of how long failures take to fix or to be forgotten.
      Operational experience may further refine these expectations.</t>

      <t>Before removing the NTA, all authoritative resolvers listed in the
      zone should be checked (due to anycast and load balancers it may not be
      possible to check all instances).</t>

      <t>Once all testing succeeds, an NTA should be removed as soon as is
      reasonably possible. One possible method to automatically determine when
      the NTA can be removed is to send a periodic query for type SOA at the
      NTA node; if it gets a response that it can validate (whether the
      response was an actual SOA answer or a NOERROR/NODATA with appropriate
      NSEC/NSEC3 records), the NTA is presumed no longer to be necessary and
      is removed. Implementations SHOULD, by default, perform this operation.
      Note that under some circumstances this is undesirable behavior (for
      example, if www.example.com has a bad signature, but example.com/SOA is
      fine) and so implementations may wish to allow the operator to override
      this spot-check / behavior.</t>

      <t>When removing the NTA, the implementation SHOULD remove all cached
      entries at and below the NTA node.</t>

    <section anchor="Comparison-to-Other-DNS-Misconfigurations"
             title="Comparison to Other DNS Misconfigurations" toc="include">
      <t>Domain administrators are ultimately responsible for managing and
      ensuring their DNS records are configured correctly. ISPs or other DNS
      recursive resolver operators cannot and should not correct misconfigured
      A, CNAME, MX, or other resource records of domains for which they are
      not authoritative. Expecting non-authoritative entities to protect
      domain administrators from any misconfiguration of resource records is
      therefore unrealistic and unreasonable, and in the long-term is harmful
      to the delegated design of the DNS and could lead to extensive

      <t>Some domains, such as dnssec-failed.org, have been intentionally
      broken for testing purposes <xref
      target="Measuring-DNSSEC-Validation-of-Website-Visitors"/> <xref
      target="Netalyzr"/>. For example, dnssec-failed.org is a DNSSEC-signed
      domain that is broken. If an end user is querying a validating DNS
      recursive resolver, then this or other similarly intentionally broken
      domains should fail to resolve and should result in a "Server Failure"
      error (RCODE 2, also known as 'SERVFAIL'). If such a domain resolved
      successfully, then it is a sign that the DNS recursive resolver is not
      fully validating.</t>

      <t>Organizations that utilize NTAs should not add an NTA for any
      intentionally broken domain. Such additions are prevented by the
      requirement that the operator attempt to contact the administrators for
      the zone that has broken DNSSEC.</t>

      <t>Organizations operating an intentionally broken domain may wish to
      consider adding a TXT record for the domain to the effect of "This
      domain is purposely DNSSEC broken for testing purposes".</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discovering broken domains">
      <t>Discovering that a domain is DNSSEC broken as result of an operator
      error instead of an attack is not trivial, and the examples here should
      be vetted by an experienced professional before taking the decision on
      implementing an NTA.</t>

      <t>One of the key thing to look for when looking at a DNSSEC broken
      domain is consistency and history. It therefore is good if you have the
      ability to look at the server's DNS traffic over a long period of time
      or have a database that stores DNS names associated answers (this is
      often referred to as a "passive DNS database"). Another invaluable tool
      is DNSViz (http://dnsviz.net) which also stores DNSSEC related data
      historically. The drawback here is that you need for it to have tested
      the domain before the incident occurs.</t>

      <t>The first and easiest thing to check is if the failure of the domain
      is consistent across different software implementations. If not, you
      want to inform the vendor where it fails so that the vendor can look
      more deeply into the issue.</t>

      <t>The next thing is to figure out what the actual failure mode is. At
      the time of this writing are several tools to do this, including:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>DNSViz (http://dnsviz.net)</t>

          <t>Verisign DNSSEC debugger
          (http://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com)</t>

          <t>zonemaster (http://www.zonemaster.fr,
          https://github.com/dotse/zonemaster)</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>most of these tools are open source and can be installed locally.
      However, using the tools over the Internet has the advantage of
      providing visibility from a different point. This is an incomplete list,
      and it is expected that additional tools will be developed over time to
      aid in troubleshooting DNSSEC issues.</t>

      <t>Once you figure out what the error is, you need to check if it shows
      consistently around the world and from all authoritative servers. Use
      DNS Tools (dig) or DNS looking glasses to verify this. An error that is
      consistently the same is more likely to be operator caused than an
      attack. Also if the output from the authoritative server is consistently
      different from the resolvers' output this hints to an attack rather then
      an error, unless there is EDNS0 client subnet
      (draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-client-subnet) applied to the domain.</t>

      <t>A last check is to look at the actual DNS data. Is the result of the
      query still the same or has it changed? While a lot of DNSSEC errors
      occur on events that change DNSSEC data, the actual record someone wants
      to go to often stays the same. If the data is the same, this is an
      indication (not a guarantee) that the error is operator caused. Keep in
      mind that with DNS being used to globally balance traffic the data
      associated to a name might be different in different parts of the
      Internet.</t>

      <t>Here are some examples of common DNSSEC failures that have been seen
      as operator signing errors on the Internet:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>RRSIG timing issue. Each signature has an inception time and
          expiry time, between which it is valid. Letting this time expire
          without creating a new signature is one of the most common DNSSEC
          errors. To a lesser extent, this also occurs if signatures were made
          active before the inception time. For all of these errors your
          primary check is to check on the data. Signature expiration is also
          about the only error we see on actual data (like www.example.com).
          All other errors are more or less related to dealing with the chain
          of trust established by DS records in the parent zone and DNSKEYs in
          the child zones. These mostly occur during key rollovers, but are
          not limited to that.</t>

          <t>DNSKEYs in child zone don't match the DS record in the parent
          zone. There is a big variation of this that can happen at any point
          in the key lifecycle. DNSViz is the best tool to show problems in
          the chain. If you debug yourself, use dig +multiline so that you can
          see the key id of a DNSKEY. Common Variations of this can be:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>DS pointing to a non existent key in the child zone.
              Questions for consideration here include: Has there ever been a
              key (and, if so, was it used)? Has there been a recent change in
              the DNSKEY RRSet (indicating a key rollover)? Has the actual
              data in the zone changed? Is the zone DNSSEC signed at all and
              has it been in the past?</t>

              <t>DS pointing to an existent key, but no signatures are made
              with the key. The checks above should be done, with the addition
              of checking if another key in the DNSKEY RRSet is now used to
              sign the records.</t>

              <t>Data in DS or DNSKEY doesn't match the other. This is more
              common in initial setup when there was a copy and paste error.
              Again checking history on data is the best you can do there.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>All of the above is just a starting point for consideration when
      deciding whether or not to deploy a trust anchor. It is not possible to
      provide a simple checklist to run through to determine whether a domain
      is broken because of an attack or an operator error.</t>

      <t>End to end DNSSEC validation will be disabled during the time that an
      NTA is used. In addition, the NTA may be in place after the point in
      time when the DNS misconfiguration that caused validation to break has
      been fixed. Thus, there may be a gap between when a domain has been
      re-secured and when an NTA is removed. In addition, an NTA may be put in
      place by DNS recursive resolver operators without the knowledge of the
      authoritative domain administrator for a given domain name. However,
      attempts SHOULD be made to contact and inform the domain administrator
      prior to putting the NTA in place.</t>

      <t>One side effect of implementing an NTA is that it may break client
      applications that assume that a domain is signed and expect an AD bit in
      the response. It is expected that many application that require DNSSEC
      for a domain will perform their own validation, and so this should not
      be a major issue.</t>

      Anchor functionality for the zone foo.example.com.</t>

      <t>Note: These are simply examples - nameserver operators are expected
      to test and understand the implications of these operations. Note also
      that some of available implementations may not implement all recommended
      functionality in this document. In that case it is advisable to request
      the developer or vendor of the implementation to support the missing
      feature, rather than start using the incomplete implementation.</t>

      Added text to address the need for manual investigation, as suggested by
      Patrik Falstrom. Added a suggestion on notification as suggested by Marc
      Lampo. Made several additions and changes suggested by Ralf Weber, Wes
      Hardaker, Nick Weaver, Tony Finch, Shane Kerr, Joe Abley, Murray
      Kucherawy, Olafur Gudmundsson.</t>

      <t>Individual-04: Moved the section defining an NTA forward, and added
      new text to the Abstract and Introduction per feedback from Paul
      Hoffman.</t>

      <t>Individual-05: Incorporated feedback from the DNSOP WG list received
      on 2/17/13 and 2/18/13. This is likely the final version before the IETF
      86 draft cutoff date. Updated references to RFC6781 to RFC6781, per
      March Davids.</t>

      <t>Individual-06: Added more OPEN issues to continue tracking WG
      discussion. No changes in the main document - just expanded issue
      tracking.</t>

      <t>Individual-07: Refresh document - needs revision and rework before
      IETF-91. Planning to add more contributors.</t>

          <t>Issue: Notify the domain owner of the validation failure -
